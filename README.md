# Turing Dashboard

_Note: Work in progress!_

Turing Dashboard is a small web application for displaying a status dashboard of sorts on a TV screen. 

It's intended for showing 'Items' - widget-ish components, each with a specific purpose. These could be things like a Tube Status item showing whether the Tube is in a usable state, or an app that shows the Club's public calendar. Items are not built into the Dashboard itself; the Dashboard is for showing imported Items.

The Dashboard is being made with large screens specifically in mind, but will still respond down to smaller screen sizes.

The Dashboard uses the latest CSS features as of this writing, including Grid and Custom Properties. Therefore, a modern browser, such as Chrome, is recommended.
