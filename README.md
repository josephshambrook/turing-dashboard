# Turing Dashboard

_Note: Work in progress!_

Turing Dashboard is a small web application I'm making for displaying a status dashboard of sorts on our TV screen at our workplace. 

It's intended for showing 'Items' - widget-ish components, each with a specific purpose. These could be things like a Tube Status item showing whether the Tube is in a usable state, or an app that shows the Club's public calendar. Items are not built into the Dashboard itself; the Dashboard is for showing imported Items.

The dashboard is being made with large screens specifically in mind, but will still respond down to smaller screen sizes.
